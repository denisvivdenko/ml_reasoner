# Idea:

Inspired by the course "Introduction to ML stategy" from Andrew Ng. The idea is to gather all the advices into one knowledge base and then use them to make reasoning for next best iteration. I want it to be a framework which will be used for model iteration.

# Functionality:

- [ ] Keep track of progress
- [ ] Keep track of metrics
- [ ] Set up optimizing and satisficing metrics
- [ ] Split dataset (train/train-dev/dev/test sets)
- [ ] Error analysis
- [ ] Detect variance/bias/data mismatch
- [ ] Suggest best strategy
